# Menucord

A lightweight macOS menu bar app that displays your Discord notification count directly in the menu bar.

Once running, the app will:
- Display ðŸ’¬ 0 when you have no notifications
- Display ðŸ’¬ 2 when you have 2 unread notifications
- Update automatically every 2 seconds (interval adjustment TBD)
- Display an Error if Discord is not detected

## How It Works

This app uses macOS's private Launch Services API to read Discord's dock badge label. This is the same badge count you see on Discord's dock icon. 

The app queries Launch Services every 2 seconds to check for badge updates, making it lightweight and efficient.


## To Do
- Interval adjustment menu
- Custom Icon?
- Ensure CPU/RAM/Power usage is not insane
